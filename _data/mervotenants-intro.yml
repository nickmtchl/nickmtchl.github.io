Honesty and authenticity matters. We get to personally know each student. Being flexible and be accountable is important for 
he process to work! Even more important is the ability to listen intentionally and receive information with interest for 
direction and accomplishment. While allowing students to lead their own explorations, there is a processing of feelings that 
s uplifting and rewarding as an example of success! Be that example!"

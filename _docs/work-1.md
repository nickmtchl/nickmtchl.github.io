So you are looking at the work page of the website, and you are thinking "I want to change the hover picture that I see when I'm hovering for some of the projects."

From the siteleaf admin panel, select Work.  CLick on one of the project pages (bradford, noisy lemonade) and look for this metadata at the bottom of page: 'work_hover_img'.  By changing the location of this image, this will update the background image that shows. Select Save.

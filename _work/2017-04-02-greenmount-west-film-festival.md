		<p>The Pizza Party Tour is a mobile platform in which we strive to simply support those in need. The

		provide for the event. The Pizza Party Tour, is just that- a party. The concept derives from the childhood
		memories of when pizza parties were thrown. We all remember the joy and pure fun a pizza party brings.</p>' %}

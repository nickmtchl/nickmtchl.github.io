		content-text="Mergenthaler Vocational Technical-High School (Mervo) is one of the largest academic trade programs in baltimore city, enrolling over 1500 students. Mervo has 22 state-approved trades courses for students to enter into, including: Business Management, CADD(Coumputer Aided Drawing and Design), Carpentry, Commercial Baking, Graphic Arts and Printing, Masonry, and Plumbing.<br/><br/>
		Mervo's mission is to educate students to function in an industrial and challenging technological society. Noisy Tenants builds on this mission by creating opportunities for students to take on projects that promote ownership and design thinking in their fields. We utilize our 'noisy' process to pull creative solutions from students and drive meaningful engagement. Students participate in intense COLLABORATION, BRAINSTORMING, and problem solving with an entrepreneurial focus. From this engangement we utilize our network of partners to create unique opportunities for ownership. Our first year resulted in @NoisyBurger, a one week pop-up restaurant designed by students in the commercial baking trade.<br/><br/>
		We build on these ownership opportunities by creating an atmosphere conveys the importance of students using their talents and training to invest in their communities. Our capstone 2016/17 capstone project, @NoisyBurger, was a one week op up restaurant, that provided initial funding for Noisy Lemonade - a social enterprise that allows youth in Greenmount West to operate their own lemonade stands."

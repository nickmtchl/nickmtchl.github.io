    title="Welcome to Noisy Burger!"
    text="<p>Noisy Burger! is a one week pop-up restaurant created by students at Mergenthaler Vocational Technical High School. Students developed concept, menu, and operated the restaurant in the pop-up stall at R. House located in Remington. Noisy Burger set records for weekend sales for pop-up and permanent locations. Be on the lookout for future restaurant concepts!</p>
<p>The first student launched restaurant in Baltimore City!

Noisy Tenants worked with students over their senior to develop the project. We drove communication to discover passions and post-high school plans. A majority of students aspired to own and operate a small business following graduation.</p>"

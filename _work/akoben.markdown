    text="<p>The Akoben Foundation is a Baltimore City based non profit focused on ensuring that all early learners are fully equipped with the literacy skills necessary to read at or above grade level by the end of 3rd grade.</p>
<p>Through their Reading, Rhythm and the Arts program, an interactive after school program for grades Pre-K â€“ 3rd Noisy Tenants worked with youth four days out of each week preparing to present two play productions to friends, family, and the faculty of the school.</p>
<p>As apart of our preparation we worked with them to translate book content to screenplay format. This consisted of daily reading sessions. We also instructed them on stage blocking and acting basics through fun interactive games.</p>
<p>that artistically dynamically fuses reading literacy and the performing arts. Reading, Rhythm and the Arts brings much focus to reading fluency, comprehension, and vocabulary development; while fostering a creative mind within students that makes the learning process fun.  Literacy is the pre-requisite for all success; our goal is to ensure that every student who goes through Reading, Rhythm and the Arts is equipped with the skills necessary to be career leadership and college ready.</p>"
